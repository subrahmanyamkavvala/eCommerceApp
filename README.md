# eCommerceApp with the JetPack compose with Use-Case , MVI desing pattern
Android eCommerce Demo application buidl using the clean architectured

The following mock server apis are used to demonstrate the eCommerce applicatoin
https://app.beeceptor.com/mock-server/fake-store-api

The below are the layer for separation of concerns and demonstration


* Compose  - > Material Compose for the later resposive UI patterns with Uni Directiond Flow desing pattern
* ViewModel : with MVI Patterns  having the STATE which is the single point of data modiction the Screen state
* Use case layer / Domain : Layer  :  Layer between Presentation and Data responsible Business logic of the application with the single responsibility of all the use cases well defined.
* Mappers : To map DTO to Domain /UI Models any time the data source is chagens its easy to switch to new data source with out any change to the Presentation layer
* Data Layer : Single source of truth is the repository pattern which connect with different data source (local/remote) and aggregate the response and send to the upper layer.

The Clean architecture provides strong benifits for the large enterprice application like media , OTT, banking and eCommerce etc. 

* Scalability : As each layer separated their own concerns and resposibilities its easy bring new feature or new module which can easily scale.
* Testability.: Each layer can be tested indepently , the Data and Domin can be tested on JVM as its completed written in JVM apis which can be tested wiht out running applicaton
* Maintainabilit : Easy to maintain in the large scale appplication .
